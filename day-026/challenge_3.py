# Instructions
# Take a look inside file1.txt and file2.txt. They each contain a bunch of numbers, each number on a new line.
#
# You are going to create a list called result which contains the numbers that are common in both files.
#
# e.g. if file1.txt contained:
#
# 1
# 2
# 3
# and file2.txt contained:
#
# 2
# 3
# 4
# result = [2, 3]
#
# IMPORTANT: The result should be a list that contains Integers, not Strings. Try to use List Comprehension instead of a Loop.
#
# Example Output
# [3, 6, 5, 33, 12, 7, 42, 13]

with open("file1.txt", "r") as file_1:
    file_1_data = file_1.readlines()

with open("file2.txt", "r") as file_2:
    file_2_data = file_2.readlines()

file_1_numbers = [int(num.strip()) for num in file_1_data]
file_2_numbers = [int(num.strip()) for num in file_2_data]

result = [num for num in file_1_numbers if num in file_2_numbers]

# Write your code above ðŸ‘†

print(result)
